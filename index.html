  <p> <b>Jonny Keenan</b> - Hey! My name is Jonny Keenan. I've been playing music for 10 years and recording for 7. I've loved music ever since I can remember. Having grown up in a family where music was literally constantly playing or being played, I didn't stand a chance! I love producing because it helps me capture moments and emotions in music. It's almost like a photograph to me.</p> 
  <p>My main goal in working with an artist or band, is to help them achieve the vision and sound they have for their project. I'm invested in every song and always do my best. Whether it's mixing, songwriting or producing, I treat every project the same. I want them to leave happy with the exact thing they had in mind - maybe even more! So, let's create something together. I'd love to see what we can come up with!</p>

  <p><b>Seth Goodwin</b> - Hi, my name is Seth Goodwin, and I’ve been playing/recording music since I was 14. My music journey started when I fell in love with a 1960’s pop group called the Monkees. Shortly afterwards, I began learning to play Drums, Guitar, and Bass.</p> 
  <p>Later on, I started to pursue songwriting and production as a casual pastime to do with my friends. I became obsessed with trying to find out the secrets of why some choruses would be stuck in my head for days on end, while others were so boring I would forget them two seconds after hearing them. Over time, I’ve become well-versed in the areas of production and mixing.
  </p>
  <p>
  My main goal with an artist is to take the vision that they bring me, and crank that thing up to 11. I don’t want to force something on them that they don’t want to use, but I want to push them creatively to make what they already envision even better. I want to take that 1080p iPhone photo and turn it  into a 4k DSLR photo that they can hang in their hallway (Right next to their weird looking coat hanger and that creepy elf-on-a-shelf they forgot to put away after Christmas.)
